# Nicola - A Singers Website

This is my first Milestone project with Code Institute for my first ever web project.
I decided to create a website for a famliy member who is a singer along the lines of a suggested project withing the course (Build a website for a band).
The aim of the project is give my neice web presence and show-case her abilities to fans and potential employers.


<!-- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.   -->
 
## UX

 ### User Stories
  
 #### As A Fan:

I want to find out more about Nicola.

I want to hear Nicola's Music.

I want to see pictures of Nicola.

I want to be updated on when and where nicola is next performing.

#### As the Site owner

I want to have a Web presence.

I want to update and inform my fans.

I want to showcase my singing.

I want to increase my visibility to prospective employers.



### Design

I aim to create a Minimialistic stylish site which features a visual experice.  I plan to have 3 pages.  
The first page will have a mix of pictures and storys which introduces nicola as a singer/artist and 
sections about Nicola. The second page will be a gallery of  Pictures, music and videos of past performances.
The final page will be a sign up page for fans / contact page for prospective employers and availabilty to 
host singing events (weddings/parties/clubs etc.) 


### Wireframes

To Bring the project to life, I used Balsamic to create wireframe mockups of how I wanted the website to look.
These are listed bleow

- wireframes to be added here


 
<!--Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

<!--In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.>
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used  (expected)

* [Google Fonts:](https://www.fonts.google.com)

  - Used to import custom fonts

* [Font Awsome:](https://www.fontawesome.com) 

  - Used to import icons

* [GitHub:](https://www.github.com.com)

  - Used to save the code which is pushed from gitpod. 

* [Gitpod:](https://www.gitpod.io.com)

   - used to create the code and version control using commits and comments.

* [Bootstrap 4:](https://www.getbootstrap.com)

  - used to assist in a responsive site with a mobile first ethos 

* [Balsamic:](https://www.balsamiq.com)

   - Used to create the skeleton of the project and initial feel of how I planned it to look. 



## Testing

<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
-->
## Deployment

<!--
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
