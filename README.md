## <u>UX</u>

 ### User Goals
  
 #### New Fan Goals

I want to be updated on when and where nicola is next performing.

#### Returning Fan Goals

#### User Stories

### Structure of the website

I want the website to be easily accessible, simple to navigate and user freindly. It must also be displayed 
  for various devices (desktop ,Tablet, Mobile Phone) whilst maintaining a great user experience . Links within the website directing me to other Pages either within
  this website or to other social media accounts (youtube etc). I waould like to have effects like hover to bring the website alive and encourages interaction.


### Wireframes

I used Balsamic to create wireframe mockups of how I envisioned the website to look.
These are listed bleow

- wireframes to be added here

## <u>Features</u>

As this is a new project the website will consist of 3 pages with view to increase as neccesary (see features left to implement below.)
Home page, Gallery and Contact page.

#### Fonts

- The main font used is 'Kodchasan' with back-up of  sans-serif  obtained from [Google-fonts](www.fonts.google.com)

#### Images

- Most Images are sourced direct from the singers social media.  In time these can be replaced with higher quality images.  The cover picture was created by the singer.

- [unsplash](www.unsplash.com) used for images as well. see [#credits](#credits)

#### Navbar and footer

- Both have same sytling and colors for consitancy. This is reflected across all pages of the website.
- Navbar located at top with 'Brand' to the left and a responsive menu on the right. For Mobile and tablet this is 
  an expanding 'Hamburger' menue opening below the icon to reveal the three pages (Home, Gallery and Contact).
  On desktop the 'hamburger'  is replaced wth links for the 3 pages.  

- Navbar play button.   Once fully implemented this will allow the user to play a singers song while in the website. 

- Footer is located at the bottom and contains a 'call to action' contact button that takes to contact page.  Below are Social media links.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- 

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future: -->

#### Future Features 

- Fully functioning Play/stop button in the footer.  Currently can be played, but no control options and icon should ideally change 
to a pause button.

- a Seperate Video/ music page. 

- Merchandise page 

- incorporate a presskit/review section into the website by either a new page or addition to other.

- A News blog which links to recent performances or live stream events as well as other relevant news.

## <u>Testing</u>

### Functionality testing
### Compatibility testing
### Code Validation
-  https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
-  https://validator.w3.org/
### User stories testing
### Issues found during development
### Performance testing

<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
-->

## <u>Deployment</u>

<!--
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
