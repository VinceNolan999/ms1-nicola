## A User-Centric Frontend Milestone Project

- This is my first Milestone project with Code Institute and my first ever web design.

The aim of the project is give my niece web presence for potential employers and show-case her abilities to fans and potential employers.

#### Navbar and footer

- Both have same styling and colors for consistency. This is reflected across all pages of the website.

- Navbar located at top with 'Brand' to the left and a responsive menu on the right. For Mobile and tablet this is

## <u>Testing</u>

 - Navbar
    - Clicking on the links from each page takes you to the correct location. 
    In addition the correct link is highlighted as the active page.
    - On gallery and Navbar clicking 'Nicola' brand takes to main page.
    - drop down menu works correctly on each page.

   - Hovering over images transitions them larger with no visible issues.

- Gallery
    - All images have transition effect on hover with no obvious issues. Number of columns changes 
    depending on virtual device used.

- Contact Page.
    - testing revealed missing 'required' and also contact form not acting as expected. Bootsnipp template contact form
    did not start with the 'form' heading and was not displaying the 'please fill in this field' for the input boxes as a result. 
    This has been fixed.

    - test: left first name blank.  pressed submit, box red outline  around all boxes and 'please fill in field'.
    - test: left first name entered.   pressed submit, red outline in empty boxes and 'please fill in field' shown in last name.
    - test: invalid email entered. Requested valid email and red outline.
    - test: valid email entered and works as expected.
    - test: all inputs completed except comment box.  red outline on comments and 'please fill in field' shown.
    - test: all fields completed correctly.  Upon submit the entry's act as thou they are sent and form resets.

### Functionality testing

- Mozilla Browser used to run Gitpod and developer tools used to test , solve problems, style and responsiveness.
Chrome developer tools used to check compatibility during project and to check on consistency of Mozilla dev tools.

### Compatibility testing

- I have tested the website on the virtual devices contained with the Dev Tools of Mozilla and Chrome with no 
issues seen on either. A wide range of screen sizes tested from mobile, tablet and desktop.

- I have tested compatibility on the github pages published website of the project on a 1920 x 1080 monitor, a galaxy s7 
and a Motorola  one+ mobile phone with no issues noted.

### Code Validation
-  https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/   
    - passed with no errors found. This document validates as CSS level 3 + null !
-  https://validator.w3.org/
    - all pages checked with no issues. 
-  https://wave.webaim.org/ - A web accessibility checker
    - no errors or contrast errors detected. 
    - contrast passed . Contrast Ratio of 5.08 on about me page and 5.12 on contact page.

### User stories testing

- I want to find out how Nicola became a singer.
    - On main navigation page the about me section is present.

- I want know where and when Nicola is next performing
    - On the main page scrolling to the bottom presents the events section.

- I want to see pictures of Nicola.
    - From the navigation bar I can select the Gallery link which then displays images of Nicola
 
- I want to be able to contact Nicola as I want to hire her to sing at my event.
    - On the navigation bar there is a link for Contact. Selecting this takes me to a contact form where I can
    input my details and leave a message.

- I want to contact Nicola as I am an artist and would like to collaborate with Nicola.
    - There is a contact page where I can leave my details and message for Nicola.

### Issues found during development

- Fixed Navbar caused content go underneath. After trying margins and padding's on the divs and sections to solve this to 
no avail I found that using padding-top on the body tag pushed content lower and solved the issue. This led to other issues where 
I then made the navbar a fixed height which caused no background to be displayed on the drop down menu. This was fixed 
by changing to min-height for navbar and therefore making sizing of the navbar predictable and easier.

- Initially had a carousel to display the event section, this caused some issues where the page seems to be flicking when the image changed.
This feature didn't look particularly good so was removed with advice from the mentor.  

- gallery images - adding container- fluid solved issue with borders on left and right. 

- gallery image display. column sizes changed for better layout. xl-3 added for full screen viewing. md-3 changed to 4 which is better for i-pad pro. scaling of images better.
They were becoming squashed as too many items being displayed.  I have set media queries for different view sizes to keep them at the intended sizes.

- The contact page had a minor display issue when viewing on small mobile devices. When the contents were moved into block form
the background was showing where it should be the contents box.  Issue resolved by adding 5px to the padding-right.

- The contact page display was having issues with tablet displays. White space present at the bottom due to height of display. Scaled well on mobile/desktop. 
setting vh-100 solved this however then caused issue with the block element overlapping low height display. 
Finally settled on including a min-height of 790px which fixed the height issues.

- The Navbar had a particularly annoying issue that was limited to I pad devices where 1px Grey horizontal lines were visible in the footer section of all pages
and also in-between the event heading and event images.  This was solved for me by moving the ' h4 - Upcoming events' onto the top of the box container for 
the events section.  Prior to this it was nested above in its own Div that closed at start of the event images. This coincidentally stopped
all the Grey lines including them in the footer.


### Performance testing

  - I have used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) for the performance testing.
The first attempt showed a few performance drops on mobile devices. These included no meta values for the social media links, a h4 header being used, no meta description and older image format used.

- These were addressed and the results as follows.

#### Desktop performance
